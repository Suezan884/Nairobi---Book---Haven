TITLE: Bookstore Customer Service Chatbot Using Rule-Based and NLP Techniques 

Introduction 

Small and medium-sized bookstores in Kenya rely heavily on WhatsApp, phone calls, and walk-in customers. Staff members repeatedly answer the same questions about opening hours, delivery, M-Pesa payments, location, and book availability. This repetitive work reduces the time they can spend on actual sales and customer care. 

This project aimed to design and implement a low-cost, easy-to-deploy chatbot that can: 

Answer common FAQs instantly (24/7) 

Allow customers to search the book catalog by title, author, genre, or price 

Work well even with the limited resources typical of Kenyan small businesses 

The chatbot combines simple rule-based logic with basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and was trained and tested using frequently asked questions.  

 

1. Problem Understanding  

Local businesses in Kenya, such as bookstores, frequently receive repeated customer questions about: 

location 

payment methods 

delivery 

opening hours 

book availability 

A chatbot can help: 

reduce workload for staff 

provide instant responses 

help customers search for books 

improve customer experience 

This project develops a simple chatbot using rule-based and NLP methods trained on a small FAQ dataset. 

 

2. Data Collection & Processing  

We created two synthetic datasets: 

a) FAQs.csv (Customer Questions) 

Collected 94 real bookstore questions with columns: 

question 

intent 

response 

Intents included: greeting, hours, delivery, payment, contact, location, thanks, goodbye, genre. 

b) Books.csv (Catalog Data) 

Contains 156 books with: 

title 

author 

genre 

price 

Data preprocessing steps: 

cleaned column names 

removed trailing spaces 

converted prices to numeric 

generated intent keywords 

performed EDA (word counts, intent distribution) 

This ensured the data was ready for training and searching. 

 

3. Chatbot Implementation  

The chatbot uses two methods combined: 

A) NLP Intent Classification (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) 

Vectorized the FAQ questions 

Trained a classifier to predict the intent 

Returned the response from the dataset 

B) Rule-Based Book Search 

Searches books based on: 

title 

author 

genre 

price range 

This hybrid system lets the bot answer both FAQ questions and catalog queries. 

 

4. Testing & Improvement  

The chatbot was tested using several user inputs: 

“What are your opening hours?”  

“Do you deliver to Nairobi?” 

“Show me books by Ngugi.” 

“Find fantasy novels.”  

Improvements made: 

fixed inconsistent column casing 

added rule-based detection for book queries 

improved formatting of book results 

handled misclassified intents 

improved keyword cleaning 

The model accuracy improved after preprocessing and cleaning. 

 

5. Challenges & Local Language Issues  

Some challenges included: 

a) Limited dataset 

Only about 100 FAQ questions are causing the model accuracy to be limited  

b) Mixed language use 

Kenyan customers may use: 

English 

Swahili 

Sheng 
Example: “mna deliver?”  

The current model fails on many of these because the training data is mostly English. 

 

Adding more multilingual examples would improve accuracy. 

c) Misspellings and partial author names 

Users may type: 

“Alchmist” instead of “Alchemist” (spelling errors) 

“ngugi wa” (partial name) 

Fuzzy matching or semantic models could improve this. 

 

Future Improvement  

Collect 500–1000 real queries (ongoing logging)   

Add Swahili and Sheng examples to the training data   

Use phonetic matching or small language models fine-tuned on Kenyan text   

Integrate session memory for follow-up questions 

 

6. Conclusion 

A functional hybrid chatbot was successfully built. It answers: 

customer service questions 

book availability queries 

basic search functions 

This system can assist bookstores in Kenya to automate customer support and improve response time.
